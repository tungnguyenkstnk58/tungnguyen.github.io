### **Spring 2024 (with [Fabio Bonassi](https://www.it.uu.se/katalog/fabbo794) and [Daniel Arnström](https://www.it.uu.se/katalog/danar782)), Spring 2023 (with [Niklas Wahlström](http://www.it.uu.se/katalog/nikwa778) and [Carl Andersson](http://www.it.uu.se/katalog/caran948)), Spring 2022 (with [Dave Zachariah](http://www.it.uu.se/katalog/davza513))**

### **About the course**

System models: State-space forms and the solution of the state-space equation in discrete and continuous time. Sampling. Transfer functions and transfer operators. Model transformations from transfer functions to state-space models and vice versa.

System properties: Controllability and observability. Static gain. Step and impulse responses in discrete and continuous time. Frequency domain properties (connection to sampling). Stability in discrete and continuous time; asymptotic stability, bounded-input bounded-output stability, the Nyquist criterion.

Controller design: Pole placement in state-space form. State feedback with observer. PID controllers. Stability margins. Sensitivity functions. The notion of robustness. Computer implementation (sampling, aliasing).


### **Learning outcomes**

On completion of the course, the student should be able to:

define basic concepts in automatic control

determine relations between different model representations

analyse linear time-invariant systems with respect to relevant properties

design and implement simple controllers
