**About the course**

The course covers both continuous-time and discrete-time linear systems. It includes a sampling of continuous-time systems and an introduction to discrete-time systems. Stochastic processes are introduced and used as models for disturbances, and the Kalman filter is introduced as a tool for estimation and prediction. Based on this, LQ/LQG and MPC are presented as examples of optimal controllers.
