Tung is currently pursuing a PhD and working on security in networked control systems with [Andr√© Teixeira](https://www.andre-teixeira.eu/) and [Prof. Alexander Medvedev](https://user.it.uu.se/~am/am.new.html) at the [Division of Systems and Control](http://www.it.uu.se/about_us/divisions/systems_and_control/people), [Department of Information Technology](https://it.uu.se/), [Uppsala University](https://uu.se/), Sweden. Tung is one of the first memebers of [Uppsala Secure Learning Lab](https://uslc-lab.github.io/).

He was born in 1995, Hanoi city, Vietnam. He received the Degree of Engineer in Automatic Control (5 year Talent program) from the Department of Automatic Control, School of Electrical Engineering, [Hanoi University of Science and Technology](https://hust.edu.vn/en/), Hanoi, Vietnam in 2018. In 2017, he was selected as [Top 10 Young Engineer and Scientist Award](https://www.hondafoundation.jp/yes/index_en/232) granted by the Honda Foundation. He was a [visiting student](https://www.hondafoundation.jp/yes/view_en/1194) at the [WPI International Institute for Carbon-Neutral Energy Research](https://i2cner.kyushu-u.ac.jp/en/), [Kyushu University](https://www.kyushu-u.ac.jp/en/), Fukuoka, Japan from September to December 2018. From 2019 to 2021, he was a research assistant at the [Guidance, Navigation, and Control Laboratory](http://sejong-gnclab.com/), [Sejong University](https://en.sejong.ac.kr/eng/index.do), Seoul, Korea. He received the Degree of Master of Engineering in Aerospace Engineering from the Department of Aerospace Engineering, [Sejong University](https://en.sejong.ac.kr/eng/index.do), Seoul, Korea in 2021.

Security and resilience of networked dynamical systems
======
Sustained use of critical infrastructure, such as electrical power and water distribution networks, requires efficient management and control. Facilitated by the advancements in computational devices and non-proprietary communication technology, such as the Internet, the efficient operation of critical infrastructure relies on network decomposition into interconnected subsystems, thus forming networked control systems. However, the use of public and pervasive communication channels leaves these systems vulnerable to cyber attacks. This theme aims to create novel methodologies to enhance the security and resilience of networked dynamical systems under cyber attacks.
